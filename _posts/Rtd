title: Knowing Through Making
---

So what does an engineer in the human centered design space do? They create “a product that transforms the world form its current state to a preferred state [1]” 

In my user experience (UX) learning, I stumbled across yet another term or more formally, another methodology known as ‘Research Through Design (RtD)’. This is quite a fun one as it brings together making, research and design and sets up one common goal- finding answers! 

According to … 

‘In practical terms this means that we’ll gain new knowledge via the act of making. We’ll get hands on design/make something, and then we reflect on that activity (Hello Schön!) and be able to draw out knowledge about it.[2[”

I take this literally, that is, research through design= knowing through making. Lets take a scenario in which I want to know something random…’i wonder what color keeps me most calm?’ for example. If i was set to find out this, theres many ways I could go about it. One of these could involve making something that makes my work easier, maybe an automated system that changes my wall color via lighting at certain moments and some sensors and videos that can track my mood.. or something simple and fun like this. Then what I would be doing is answering my research question
