title: Knowing Through Making
---

So what does an engineer in the human centered design space do? They create “a product that transforms the world from its current state to a preferred state [1]” 

In my Human Computer Interaction (HCI) learning, I stumbled across yet another term or more formally, another methodology known as ‘Research Through Design (RtD)’. This is quite a fun one as it brings together making, research and design and sets up one common goal- finding answers! 

According to Marcio C de C Dupont, RtD:

‘In practical terms this means that we’ll gain new knowledge via the act of making. We’ll get hands on design/make something, and then we reflect on that activity (Hello Schön!) and be able to draw out knowledge about it[2]”

I take this quite literally, that is, research through design= knowing through making. Lets take a scenario in which I want to know something random…’I wonder what color keeps my mood most calm?’ for example. If I wanted to find this out, one of the ways I could go about it is RtD. So, hook up some sensors nad videos around my room and to make my work easier, automate the system... you know, simple things. There, question answered. Knowing through making. 

What do you guys think?
